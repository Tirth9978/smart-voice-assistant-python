## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This Smart Voice Assistant listens to your voice, understands your command, and performs actions such as opening websites or folders ‚Äî all hands-free!

### üîÑ Step-by-Step Workflow:

1. **Startup Greeting**  
   The assistant greets you with a friendly message using text-to-speech (TTS).

2. **Voice Listening**  
   It listens through your microphone and waits for your command (e.g., ‚ÄúOpen Google‚Äù, ‚ÄúOpen the Web folder‚Äù).

3. **Speech Recognition**  
   It converts your voice into text using Google‚Äôs Speech Recognition API.

4. **Command Matching**  
   The assistant searches your command against:
   - `links.txt` ‚Üí for website names and URLs
   - `Local Folders.txt` ‚Üí for folder names and paths

5. **Action Execution**  
   If a match is found:
   - üåê Opens the website in your default browser  
   - üìÇ Opens the local folder using your file explorer  
   - üîä Speaks back the action being taken

6. **Error Handling**  
   If the command is not recognized or understood, the assistant responds with an error message.


This flow ensures a smooth, fast, and interactive voice-controlled experience ‚Äî great for productivity and accessibility!
